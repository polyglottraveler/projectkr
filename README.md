# Microsoft Movie Studio GTM Strategies


## The Challenge

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## The Goal & Questions to Answer

- Increase awareness
- Increase revenue (existing customers spend more & attract new customers)
- Create synergies with existing business line (servers, XBox)
- Compete with Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV

Given the background and goals, our questions of interest were:

Q1: Which studio would be the best the partner with to create video?
Q2: What genres can generate most revenue, proft and profit margin?
Q3: What are the seasonalities in movies industry?
Q4: Are there any movie categories that generate the greatest worldwide revenue?
Q5: Who are the top 5 names by worldwide revenue? Top actors/actresses?
Q6: Do TMDB ratings indicate success?

Analyzing the data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and TheMovieDB.org to answer these questions will help them formulate Go-To-Market Strategies to launch original video content.
